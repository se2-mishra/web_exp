<h1>Time machine</h1>
<p1>The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel
by using a vehicle or device to travel purposely and selectively forward or backward
through time. </p1>
<p2>The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to
such a vehicle or device.</p2><br>

<h2>Is it possible to travel back in time?</h2>
<p3><b>Time travel to the past is theoretically possible in certain general relativity
spacetime geometries that permit traveling faster than the speed of light, such as cosmic
strings, traversable wormholes, and Alcubierre drives.<b></p3>
